      "10 I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west , the bride was a red girl , Her father and his friends sat near cross - legged and dumbly smoking , they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders , On a bank lounged the trapper , he was drest mostly in skins , his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck , he held his bride by the hand , She had long eyelashes , her head was bare , her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach ' d to her feet .\n",
      "11 } Small the Theme of My Chant\n",
      "12 The female contains all qualities and tempers them , She is in her place and moves with perfect balance , She is all things duly veil ' d , she is both passive and active , She is to conceive daughters as well as sons , and sons as well as daughters .\n",
      "13 My head slues round on my neck , Music rolls , but not from the organ , Folks are around me , but they are no household of mine .\n",

      "13 The sun does arise , And make happy the skies ; The merry bells ring To welcome the Spring ; The skylark and thrush , The birds of the bush , Sing louder around To the bells ' cheerful sound ; While our sports shall be seen On the echoing Green .\n",

      "21 When the voices of children are heard on the green , And laughing is heard on the hill , My heart is at rest within my breast , And everything else is still .\n",
      "22 O little Cloud the virgin said , I charge thee to tell me Why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away : Then we shall seek thee but not find : ah Thel is like to thee .\n",
